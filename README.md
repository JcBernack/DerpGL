ObjectTK
======


ObjectTK is an extensible convenience layer for OpenGL. By itself, ObjectTK does not attempt to OO-ify the OpenGL API, but rather provide useful everyday classes which consolidate and simplify OpenGL operations.

ObjectTK is currently under rapid active development.

Features
========

- Highest possible performance.
- Full interop with "normal" OpenGL.
- Well-defined data types for all GL objects.
- Easy shader compiler.
- Highly extensible object model.
- Zero-overhead abstraction.

ObjectTK is directly run and managed by [The OpenTK Team](https://opentk.github.io/).
